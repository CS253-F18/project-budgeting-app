Iteration Report 3
-----------------------

What each person was responsible for accomplishing
-----------------------
(From iteration report 2)
 - Joe: Joe was responsible for completing the delete function, adding it to the table, and completing the unit test for the delete function.
 - Jonathan: Jonathan was responsible for completing the edit function, adding it to the table, and completing the unit test for the edit function.
 - Johnny: Johnny was responsible for updating previous unit tests and helping with new unit tests.
 - Alex: Alex was responsible for adding the date functionality to the table, and also fixing the heading for the html tables. Also, adding date to the unit test for add_income.


What was completed
-----------------------
 - Jonathan: Johnathan completed the edit functionality for our program and also added a separate page specific for editing data.
 - Joe: Joe completed the delete functionality for our program.
 - Johnny: Johnny completed the unit tests from past weeks that were not finished, and helped complete the new ones for this week.
 - Alex: Completed adding the date functionality to the program and table, and worked on fixing some of the html formatting issue.


What was planned but not finished
-----------------------
All the code for the unit tests was finished, but not all of the unit tests are funcional.


What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered
-----------------------
We encountered some issues trying to implement the edit functionality into our code. It ended up being a simple error, but from now on we know better how to go about finding errors in our code. We need to take some things one step at a time. This week went pretty smoothly for what we had planned out. We almost finished everything that we had planned and are ready for the next week. Also, the unit tests for our code do not all work. 


What adjustments to your overall design you discovered
-----------------------
We fixed the formatting for the html table, however there is still work to go from here. We realized this week, that our page is that usable for a user standpoint. Sure, we know how to use it as the creators of the app, but as a user who has never seen it before, we want it to be easy for them to navigate the page. We will be working on this next week to have a better implementation for the overall layout and usability of the page.

One important thing you learned during this iteration
-----------------------
One important thing that we learned during this iteration was that we learned how to trace errors back to find the root of a problem. We now know better how to correct errors that are not extremely obvious in the code.


Which user stories and tasks you plan to complete in the coming iteration and in the two iterations following it.
-----------------------
Week 5:
 - Continue the work that was not completed from the previous week.
 - Create a "Create User Account" page and make associated html. Test it.
 - Create a database that stores usernames and passwords.  Test it. 
 - Work on the flash message for expenses being more than the income.
 - Begin work on graphs. This will include looking for possible libraries or built in functions we could take advantage of.
 - Work on fixing the unit tests.
 
Week 6:
 - Continue the work that was not completed from the previous week.
 - Date and time of incomes and expenses being added to the table
 - Finish the impletation of the graphs, we believe that this will be a two week job. 
 
Week 7:
 - Continue the work that was not completed from the previous week.
 - Finish all user stories and unit tests that have not been completed up unto this point. The program should be done at thsi point. 
 
Who will be responsible for each user story planned for the next iteration, not the following two.
-----------------------

Week 5:
 - Joe: Joe will be responsibel for creating the "Create User Account" page, which will include input tags for inputting username and passwords.
 - Jonathan: Johnathan will work with Joe on the schema for the Login page, and making sure the functionality for logging in works. 
 - Johnny: Create a flash message for when the expenses exceep the amount of income that you have. This will eventually include the regular expenses that we would like to implement, but not for next week. 
 - Alex: Alex will get started on the implentation for the graphs. The goal for this week will be to have one kind of graph working. In the future we plan to have multiple types of graphs working.
