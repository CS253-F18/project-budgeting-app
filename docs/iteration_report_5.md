-----------------------

What each person was responsible for accomplishing
-----------------------
(From iteration report 4)
 - Joe: Get user accounts to save data on different accounts.  Personalize accounts with greeting message. Add ability to filter by date.
 - Jonathan: Get user accounts to save data on different accounts.  Add "show More" and "show less" to income and expense tables
 - Johnny: Add buttons to hide and show specific graphs.  Add bar graph. Get rounding working for all values in all tables. 
 - Alex: Get graphs working properly.  Help Jonathan with show more/less
 - Everyone: get previous unit tests working so we can focus on the new ones


What was completed
-----------------------
 - Joe: Fixed issues with the login page from last week. Login page will now show 
 - Jonathan: Added logout feature. Added filter date feature. Worked with Joe to get login page funtional. Added a remove filter button 
so the user can go back and see their entire table after adding a filter. Started making the page look better.
 - Johnny: Fixed unit tests so they are now passing in PyCharm. Added a show/hide feature for each of the graphs. Added rounding to the incomes.
 - Alex: Created 6 different graphs. They are now functional and use the data from each table.


What was planned but not finished
-----------------------
The graphs show up on the page, however, they are not functional.  Rounding for individual values in the table is not functional.


What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered
-----------------------
We had a few issues getting the login page working correctly so it only logged in with username/password combos added to the database. This was completed use paraprogramming and researching
the problem online. 


What adjustments to your overall design you discovered
-----------------------
I believe our overall design is looking good right now. We need to dedicate time in the future to ensuring there are now bugs in our program that allow users to login incorrectly. We need
to test all cases before the program in completed.


One important thing you learned during this iteration
-----------------------
We need to spend time in the future looking for bugs so there will be no way to break our application. This week we found a bug that allowed the user to login with an incorrect username
but a correct password.


Which user stories and tasks you plan to complete in the coming iteration and in the two iterations following it.

 - Add all missing unit tests. Make sure they are all passing in GitHub and PyCharm.
 - Start searching for bugs and places where the program does not work as intended by testing all cases.
