Iteration Report 7
--------------------------

What each person was responsible for accomplishing
--------------------------
(from iteration report 6)
 - Everyone: Search for bugs and places where the program does not work as intended. The application works, however there were a lot of small issues (19 to be exact) that had to be fixed to be satisfactory to turn in for the final week. The entire group met and spent times working on these issues, especially the ones that they may have created while going through the project.

What was completed
----------------------------
- Joe: Fixed that the logout button was not visible when logged in. Created a masked input for the password. Made the messages personalized. Added logic for username so that you can not use the same username multiple times. Updated login function to hash a salt and password combanation so that we are no longer storing the users passwords. 
- Jonathan: Fixed the editing of an entry making it lose its date. Fixed the filter error with incomes. Updated some flash messages when logging in. Fixed that filter date did not work for incomes. Fixed that the category did not show up when filtering by date and vice versa. Added date into edit incomes and expenses. Added comments in the code. 
- Johnny: Fixed the "Save Changes" error that was causing the app to hit a server error. Johnny also fixed all of the unit tests that were not working previously. Fixed the prepopulating error within edit. 
- Alex: Fixed the styling of graphs to make them a more realistic size. Fixed the x button to close flash messages that were not able to be closed before. Fixed an error that the graphs were not showing up. Added comments in the code. 

What was planned but not finished
------------------------------
There were two issues out of the nineteen that the team did not finish. One was just organizing show entries, and we did try to make a more organized outlook, however we did not want to close this since we will continue to work on it towards the presentation. The other issue was going to the root url while logged in currently shows the login screen. 

What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered
-------------------------------
Johnny experience a roadblock when trying to do the unit tests. There was an issue because of the url and how it was being set up. Alex hit an issue when sizing the graphs, but found out that the graphs had to be sized within the javascript and not the css to work properly. Similar issues about the font/style of the application were found and fixed. 

One important thing you learned during this iteration
--------------------------------
One important thing that we learned as group during this iteration was that finding and fixing bugs in an application can be just as hard and time consuming as creating the application. Jonathan did a great job organizing the issues in github, which made it easy to give out tasks and work on issues as a team. Without that organization, there would have been a lot of things missed or looked over. 

What you plan to complete in this time
-------------------------------------------
As a group we plan to continue finding any errors left, and debugging our application. We also plan to post this application somewhere online for free, so that during the presentation, we will be able to show the entire class, and maybe even have the class use it if possible.
